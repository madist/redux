Redux는 JavaScript 애플리케이션을위한 예측 가능한 상태 컨테이너입니다.  
(워드프레스 프레임웍과 혼동하지 마세요. – [Redux Framework](https://reduxframework.com/).)

Redux는 일관성있게 작동하고 다양한 환경 (클라이언트, 서버 및 기본)에서 실행되는 응용 프로그램을 작성하고 테스트하기 쉽도록 도와줍니다. 그뿐 아니라 다음과 같은 훌륭한 개발자 경험을 제공합니다. [live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools).

당신은 [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)와 함께 Redux 를 사용할 수 있습니다. 물론, 다른 렌더링 라이브러리와 함께 사용할 수도 있죠.  

Redux는 작습니다. (2kB, 의존성을 포함한 크기).

### 개발자 경험

나는 Redux 를 사용하였습니다. Europe Talk 리액트 작업
 [“Hot Reloading with Time Travel”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs)을 할때요. 내 목표는 최소한의 API로 상태 관리 라이브러리를 만드는 것이 었습니다. 물론, 완벽한 행동 예측을 통해서 로깅, 핫 리로딩, 시간 여행, 범용 앱, 기록 및 재생을 구현할 수 있습니다. 

### 영향

Redux는 [Flux](http://facebook.github.io/flux/)의 아이디어를 발전 시켰습니다. Redux는 [Elm](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/)으로부터 영감을 얻어 Flux 의 복잡성을 개선하였습니다.  
사용 여부와 관계없이 Redux는 시작하는 데 몇 분 밖에 걸리지 않습니다.

### Installation

To install the stable version:

```
npm install --save redux
```

This assumes you are using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as your package manager.  

If you're not, you can [access these files on unpkg](https://unpkg.com/redux/), download them, or point your package manager to them.

Most commonly people consume Redux as a collection of [CommonJS](http://webpack.github.io/docs/commonjs.html) modules. These modules are what you get when you import `redux` in a [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Browserify](http://browserify.org/), or a Node environment. If you like to live on the edge and use [Rollup](http://rollupjs.org), we support that as well.

If you don't use a module bundler, it's also fine. The `redux` npm package includes precompiled production and development [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) builds in the [`dist` folder](https://unpkg.com/redux/dist/). They can be used directly without a bundler and are thus compatible with many popular JavaScript module loaders and environments. For example, you can drop a UMD build as a [`<script>` tag](https://unpkg.com/redux/dist/redux.js) on the page, or [tell Bower to install it](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/pull/1181#issuecomment-167361975). The UMD builds make Redux available as a `window.Redux` global variable.

The Redux source code is written in ES2015 but we precompile both CommonJS and UMD builds to ES5 so they work in [any modern browser](http://caniuse.com/#feat=es5). You don't need to use Babel or a module bundler to [get started with Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/blob/master/examples/counter-vanilla/index.html).

#### Complementary Packages

Most likely, you'll also need [the React bindings](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) and [the developer tools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools).

```
npm install --save react-redux
npm install --save-dev redux-devtools
```

Note that unlike Redux itself, many packages in the Redux ecosystem don't provide UMD builds, so we recommend using CommonJS module bundlers like [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) for the most comfortable development experience.

### The Gist

The whole state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single *store*.  
The only way to change the state tree is to emit an *action*, an object describing what happened.  
To specify how the actions transform the state tree, you write pure *reducers*.

That's it!

```js
import { createStore } from 'redux'

/**
 * This is a reducer, a pure function with (state, action) => state signature.
 * It describes how an action transforms the state into the next state.
 *
 * The shape of the state is up to you: it can be a primitive, an array, an object,
 * or even an Immutable.js data structure. The only important part is that you should
 * not mutate the state object, but return a new object if the state changes.
 *
 * In this example, we use a `switch` statement and strings, but you can use a helper that
 * follows a different convention (such as function maps) if it makes sense for your
 * project.
 */
function counter(state = 0, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
  case 'INCREMENT':
    return state + 1
  case 'DECREMENT':
    return state - 1
  default:
    return state
  }
}

// Create a Redux store holding the state of your app.
// Its API is { subscribe, dispatch, getState }.
let store = createStore(counter)

// You can use subscribe() to update the UI in response to state changes.
// Normally you'd use a view binding library (e.g. React Redux) rather than subscribe() directly.
// However it can also be handy to persist the current state in the localStorage.

store.subscribe(() =>
  console.log(store.getState())
)

// The only way to mutate the internal state is to dispatch an action.
// The actions can be serialized, logged or stored and later replayed.
store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })
// 1
store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })
// 2
store.dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' })
// 1
```

Instead of mutating the state directly, you specify the mutations you want to happen with plain objects called *actions*. Then you write a special function called a *reducer* to decide how every action transforms the entire application's state.

If you're coming from Flux, there is a single important difference you need to understand. Redux doesn't have a Dispatcher or support many stores. Instead, there is just a single store with a single root reducing function. As your app grows, instead of adding stores, you split the root reducer into smaller reducers independently operating on the different parts of the state tree. This is exactly like how there is just one root component in a React app, but it is composed out of many small components.

This architecture might seem like an overkill for a counter app, but the beauty of this pattern is how well it scales to large and complex apps. It also enables very powerful developer tools, because it is possible to trace every mutation to the action that caused it. You can record user sessions and reproduce them just by replaying every action.

### Learn Redux from Its Creator

[Getting Started with Redux](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux) is a video course consisting of 30 videos narrated by Dan Abramov, author of Redux. It is designed to complement the “Basics” part of the docs while bringing additional insights about immutability, testing, Redux best practices, and using Redux with React. **This course is free and will always be.**
